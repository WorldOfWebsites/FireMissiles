## Compiling & running

## Java
You need to be able to compile and run java files. If you haven't already, install the Java Development Kit or OpenJDK.

Once you've done that, navigate to the repo and compile by running `javac FireMissiles.java`. Then run it by running `java FireMissiles`.

## Python
There are two versions: python2 and python3. Make sure you have either one or both installed on your computer. The two versions are not backwards compatible.

### For Python2
From a terminal, run `python FireMissiles.py`

### For Python3
From a terminal, run `python3 FireMissiles.py`
